Drupal upgrades have not been easy, and they should be easy. You look at
wordpress, one click and the upgrade is done! Plugins, themes and core
can all be upgraded from in the browser.

Drupal upgrades are traditionally backup, move all files out, extract
new fresh files, move selected files back. Now there is an easier way!
Patch files from <http://fuerstnet.de/en/drupal-upgrade-easier> allow
you to backup, and then inplace upgrade the Drupal core files! No nasty
moving things around that is almost guaranteed to break something
because you forgot to move something back.

I still look forward to the day when Drupal upgrades are as easy as
Wordpress. Until then, I have a good enough method!
