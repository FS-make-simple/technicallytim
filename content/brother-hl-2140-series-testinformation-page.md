Having many years ago had Brother printers that made it easy to print a
test or information page, it was good to finally find out how to do it
again. Of course, if you have the nice windows drivers, hidden in there
somewhere you can just click "Print Settings" and it will print out the
toner life, number of pages printed, etc etc. If you are using another
OS though, you won't always have that nice button.  
Thankfully the trick is fairly simple. If your printer is on but
sleeping (The large "Go" button, the blue light one is dimmed) then just
press the button once to wake it up. Once awake, press the big blue
button 3 times, slow enough that it can register each press, fast enough
that you don't take all day doing it. You get the general idea. And out
will come a "Printer Settings" page, complete with a "bar" showing
remaining drum and toner life, total pages printed (even down to the
pages printed for each paper size), and error history and what page it
happened on. Apparently it even counts paper jams.

Now I have to warn, that it doesn't always seem to get things right. I'm
sure I've had paper jams, yet it thinks I've had none. (Maybe I'm
remembering an older printer, I won't complain). It also says I've only
done about 1000 pages since getting the printer, now this I'm sure is
wrong as I printed 100's of pages for uni last semester.

Regardless, it's probably a good idea to print one of these pages when
ever you change the toner, so you can get a good idea of how many pages
you are getting out of each toner!

NB: This may or may not work on other Brother printers. It should work
for all the HL-2140 range (including the HL-2142 which is just the
HL-2140 branded exclusively for office works so no one can price match).
