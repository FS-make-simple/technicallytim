Microsoft's student "Its not stealing" campaign is supposed to make it
easy for students to afford Microsoft products so they don't need to
pirate them (and steal them). That's fine as long as it works and
Microsoft don't steal from us!

Twice I've now attempted to place an order with the online system, twice
the order has been denied however the pre-authorisation on my credit
card means I'm now \$300 "out of pocket" until the transactions are
reversed in the next 5 business days. I've called my bank (before trying
to place the order the second time) to ensure that there wasn't a
problem with my account or the credit card. No problem from the banks
end, it should have gone through.

Fittingly the email I got from them after complaining comes from "The
Ultimate Steal AU". We'll it sure is the ultimate steal, lets take your
money and give you nothing. And yes, I know I get the money back, but
it's my time and effort I'm wasting, and if I needed that money to pay a
bill, it's not there. Experiences like this sure make me want to buy
from Micro\$oft!! Oh, and if I was rich and had lots of money in my
account, each time I hit submit to attempt again (like the text
suggests) would be another \$150 pre-authorisation without success. Not
a great payment system if you ask me, no safety limits to prevent you
from trying again and again. You could easily have a few thousand
dollars in pre-auth as you keep checking the details, sure they are
correct, you hit submit.

Hopefully they can fix it faster than the amount of time I spent on hold
just to be told they can't do anything!
