This blog is somewhere for me to start posting my technical posts. I
will migrate some of my older technical posts from weirdo.bur.st to here
for archive purposes. I will also maintain [code snippits][] via bzr so
that I can update scripts I've published and so the code is easy to
access. I previously maintained SVN repositories but now prefer bzr,
personal preference.
