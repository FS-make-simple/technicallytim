For someone that prides himself on security, it is rather embarrassing
to get hacked. I currently don't know how they got in, or exactly what
they have done. I have changed my passwords and security questions
though.

So far, I know that my account was accessed from Poland (194.181.62.13)
with last access at 8:49 am today. It only appears to have been accessed
via a browser, and there don't seem to be any extra filters (forwarding)
setup. I do know that it appears everyone in my address book has been
sent a link, although the link I can see that was sent (thanks to a
bounce back) doesn't appear to work. They also deleted everything from
my sent box and trash, which is probably what annoys me the most. I
don't know if anything else has been deleted.

The most likely method they got in by was from an attack on another
site, that revealed my password from when I used the same password in
more than one place. As I no longer do this, I've been slowly changing
my passwords to all be unique, however I should have changed my gmail
one along time ago.

So 2 morals to this story. Even security conscience people can get
hacked. And backup your data from the cloud if you wish to avoid loosing
anything. I'm now in the process of setting up version controlled
backups of my gmail data.
